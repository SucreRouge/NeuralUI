Python implementation of tutorial at http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/evolved/nnt1.html

Dependencies:
Scipy stack

To run:
- Alter parameter values in Common.py (some require altering other files, described in comments)
- Execute Controller.py
- Press "F" key during game to enter accelerated simulation that generates weights and fitness plot at the end.

Feature ideas for further development:
- Multiprocessing
- Optimize params for maximum fitness over N generations
